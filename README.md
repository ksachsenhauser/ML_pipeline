# ML_pipeline
Implementation of a machine learning processing of disaster response messages. The software focus is on cleaning messages and analyze through ML - mechanisms. A useful part in a overall toolchain for message priority to support emergency response teams

# Installation
The code is based on python. Development was made under Python 3.12, which is the recommended version, although lower versions are also likly to work. Make sure to have data analytics and machine learning packages like pandas, numpy, scikit learn along with natural language toolkit nltk available. Messages are stored in an SQLITE database, the sqlite package is also necessesary. There are also jupyter notebooks with the code avaialble for a more convenient work with the code. If you want to access these notebooks, jupyter version 7.2 is recommended.

# Project
This project serves two purposes. First it is supposed to support improvements in automatic priority assignment for message streams. Additionally there is an educational purpose as this project serves to improve my data handling and machine learning experience. Hopefully, one of these purposes may also apply to you.
